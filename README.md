## Nandhini Narasimhan


I am a passionate software engineer looking for Full Stack Developer opportunities that would allow me to utilise my technical and creative abilities. 

After completing my Masters in Telecoms and Networks from City University London, I worked as Lead Release Operations Engineer and Software Quality Engineer at McAfee/Intel Security. My time at McAfee helped me create a strong foundation in both technical skills (Python,QA) and leadership skills (Scrum Master).

Information Technology has always excited me and I have taken on various challenges that would help me grow as a professional - my recent decision to quit a full time job to take on Makers Academy being one. I am also the co-founder of womenhackfornonprofits - a not for profit meet up group aimed at getting more women involved in technology to help deliver IT solutions to various charity organisations around the globe.

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

- As a trained Engineer I always look for opportunities to automate. In my role as Test Automation Engineer I enjoyed automating the end to end testing cycle including Continuous Integration(Jenkins), test automation(Python + Robot Framework) and result generation(HTML/CSS/Jenkins). 
- I also extended my role in Test Infrastructure by migrating from VMWare ESX to McAfee Cloud(vrealise automation).
- I achieved 98% test automation, 80% code and functional coverage for Threat
Intelligence component in all of McAfee Enterprise and Consumer Products.

#### Leadership

- Responsible for building, testing and releasing everyday anti-virus updates for various McAfee products globally.
- I was scrum master for development and QA teams who built the daily anti-virus update software.
- I handled sprint planning, backlog grooming, product roadmap through daily stand ups  to deliver a project which involved building and testing consumer anti-virus update ready to be released to the world.
- I co-founded womenhackfornonprofits.com, a social enterprise for women in tech to build free open source software for charities around the world.


#### Excellent Team Player

I thrive working in a team. I always go out of my way communicate openly with others and have a good relationship with all my team members.

- In my previous role as a Software Quality Engineer I always volunteered to mentor Work Experience students and Interns. I learnt a lot from pairing with them.
- I used my skills from previous roles to help my scrum master to co-ordinate sprint planning and daily stand ups when the team adapted Agile methodolgy(from a Waterfall model).
- I also wrote my tests along with the developers so that the tests are ready when the feature is complete. This saved a lot of time and technical debt.
