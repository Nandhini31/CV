## Nandhini Narasimhan


I am a passionate Engineer with leadership qualities looking to use my Software Quality Engineer skills  as a Full Stack Developer. After completing my Masters in Telecoms and Networks from City University London, I worked as Lead Release Operations Engineer and Software Quality Engineer at McAfee/Intel Security. I am looking forward to be challenge and enjoy the experience of creating good quality software that will meet my customer's needs with the power of technology.

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

- As a trained Engineer I always look for opportunities to automate. In my role as Test Automation Engineer I enjoyed automating end to end testing cycle including Continuous Integration(Jenkins), test automation(Python + Robot Framework) and result generation(HTML/CSS/Jenkins). 
- I also extended my role in Test Infrastructure by migrating from VMWare ESX to McAfee Cloud(vrealise automation).
- I achieved 98% test automation, 80% code and functional coverage for Threat
Intelligence component in all of McAfee Enterprise and Consumer Products.

#### Leadership

- Responsible for building, testing and releasing everyday anti-virus updates for various McAfee products globally.
- I was scrum master for development and QA teams who built the daily anti-virus update software.
- I handled sprint planning, backlog grooming, product roadmap through daily stand ups  to deliver a project which involved building and testing consumer anti-virus update ready to be released to the world.
- I co-founded womenhackfornonprofits.com, a social enterprise for women in tech to build free open source software for charities around the world.


#### Excellent Team Player

I thrive working in a team. I always go out of my way communicate openly with others and have a good relationship with all my team members and customers.

- In my previous role as a Software Quality Engineer I always volunteered to mentor Work Experience students and Interns. I learnt a lot from pairing with them.
- I used my skills from previous roles and helped my scrum master to co-ordinate sprint planning and daily stand ups when the team adapted Agile methodolgy(from a Waterfall model).
- I also wrote my tests along with the developers so that the tests is ready when the feature is complete. This saved a lot of time and technical debt.
