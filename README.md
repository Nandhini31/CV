## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

- Currently developing a standalone app for the Audit team using React/Redux front end with Java 8 Spring backend that consumes Kafka stream and persists the data in a Postgres DB for the EPoS 2 program at Ladbrokes Coral

- As a trained Engineer I always look for opportunities to automate any manual tasks. In my role as Test Automation Engineer I enjoyed automating the end to end testing cycle including Continuous Integration(Jenkins), test automation(Python + Robot Framework) and result generation(HTML/CSS/Jenkins). 
- I also extended my role into DevOps by migrating our Test Infrastructure from VMWare ESX to McAfee Cloud(VRealize Automation).
- I achieved 98% test automation, 80% code and functional coverage for Threat Intelligence component in all of McAfee Enterprise and Consumer Products.

#### Leadership

- I was responsible for building, testing and releasing everyday anti-virus updates for various McAfee products globally.
- I was scrum master for development and QA teams who built the daily anti-virus update software.
- I led sprint planning, backlog grooming, product roadmap through daily stand ups to focus on delivery and value to the customer iteratively.
- I co-founded womenhackfornonprofits.com, a social enterprise for women in tech to build free open source software for charities around the world.


#### Excellent Team Player

I thrive working in a team. I always go out of my way communicate openly with others and have a good relationship with all my team members.

- In my current role, I established a relationship with SMEs to gain domain knowledge. I also engaged with product owner/customers to get quick feeback of the features. 
- As a team we decided and followed Continuous Delivery approach to release frequently. We worked in small iterations on the next most valuable feature for the customer 
- In my previous role as a Software Quality Engineer I always volunteered to mentor Work Experience students and Interns. I learnt a lot from pairing with them.
- I also wrote my tests along with the developers so that the tests are ready when the feature is complete. This saved 2 sprints worth of backlog and technical debt.
