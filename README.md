## Nandhini Narasimhan


I am a passionate software engineer with Automation QA and Scrum Master background.Working with developers, I realised  building products while solving complex problems is challenging and that excites me. I decided to become a developer and  learn how to write clean, well tested code by joining Makers Academy. 

I worked as a Software Quality Engineer and  Lead Release Operations Engineer at McAfee/Intel Security. My time at McAfee helped me build a strong foundation for my technical skills (Python,QA) as well as developing my leadership abilities (Scrum Master).I am also the co-founder of [womenhackfornonprofits](http://www.womenhackfornonprofits.com/), tech community for women. 

I am looking to work with a team who are passinate about writing clean code and build a product with their customers in mind.

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

- As a trained Engineer I always look for opportunities to automate any manual tasks. In my role as Test Automation Engineer I enjoyed automating the end to end testing cycle including Continuous Integration(Jenkins), test automation(Python + Robot Framework) and result generation(HTML/CSS/Jenkins). 
- I also extended my role into Dev Ops by migrating our Test Infrastructure from VMWare ESX to McAfee Cloud(VRealize Automation).
- I achieved 98% test automation, 80% code and functional coverage for Threat Intelligence component in all of McAfee Enterprise and Consumer Products.

#### Leadership

- I was responsible for building, testing and releasing everyday anti-virus updates for various McAfee products globally.
- I was scrum master for development and QA teams who built the daily anti-virus update software.
- I handled sprint planning, backlog grooming, product roadmap through daily stand ups  to deliver a project which involved building and testing consumer anti-virus update ready to be released to the world.
- I co-founded womenhackfornonprofits.com, a social enterprise for women in tech to build free open source software for charities around the world.


#### Excellent Team Player

I thrive working in a team. I always go out of my way communicate openly with others and have a good relationship with all my team members.

- In my previous role as a Software Quality Engineer I always volunteered to mentor Work Experience students and Interns. I learnt a lot from pairing with them.
- I used my skills from previous roles to help my scrum master to co-ordinate sprint planning and daily stand ups when the team adopted Agile methodology(from a Waterfall model).
- I also wrote my tests along with the developers so that the tests are ready when the feature is complete. This saved 2 sprints worth of backlog and technical debt. 

#### Additional Skills

- Python, RobotFramework, Jenkins, Agile Methodolgies, Quality Assurance
- Basic French
